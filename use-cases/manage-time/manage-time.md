#### 🧑‍💼 Employee Actions:
1. The employee accesses the **VTS** via the intranet portal.
2. The system authenticates the user and displays:
   - Past leave requests (last 6 months)
   - Future requests (up to 18 months ahead)
   - Current leave balances
3. The employee chooses to create a new leave request.
4. The system displays available leave categories with a positive balance.
5. The employee:
   - Selects dates using a calendar
   - Specifies hours per day
   - Enters a short title and description
6. The employee submits the request.
7. The system validates the data:
   - If invalid → errors are shown and the employee can edit or cancel
   - If valid → request is saved
8. If approval is required, an email is sent to the manager.
9. The employee is redirected to the VTS homepage, and the request is marked as **Pending Approval**.

#### 👨‍💼 Manager Actions:
10. The manager opens the request via email link or logs in through the portal.
11. After authentication, the manager views:
    - Their own leave info
    - Pending approval requests from employees
12. The manager opens a request and reviews the details.
13. The manager approves or rejects the request:
    - Rejection requires a reason
14. The system updates the request status and notifies the employee by email.
15. The manager is returned to the VTS homepage and may:
    - Review more requests
    - Submit their own
    - Exit the system
